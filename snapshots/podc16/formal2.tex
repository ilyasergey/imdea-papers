\paragraph{Specification.}
%
We record a history of the snapshot data structure as a set of entries
of the form $t \mapsto (p, v)$. The entry says that at time $t$ (a
natural number), the value $v$ was written into pointer $p$. Unlike in
the linearizability proof of the snapshot structure, we need to keep
only the write events in the history. The scan events do not modify
the observable by the clients abstract state of the structure, and can
thus be omitted to simplify the considerations.

We keep the following \emph{auxiliary} variables, which are local to
each thread: $\histS$ keeps the finished write events of the
\emph{self} thread, $\histO$ keeps the finished write events of all
other threads, while $\histJ$ keeps the write events that are in
progress. When a call to {\tt write} is initiated, an auxiliary code
will place an appropriate write entry into $\histJ$; when a call
finishes, the entry is moved from $\histJ$ to $\histS$. When one
thread changes its own $\histS$, this immediately changes every other
thread's $\histO$---a discipline provided automatically by FCSL. We
name by $\hist$ the union $\histS \hunion \histO \hunion \histJ$,
which is the history of the overall snapshot data structure. The union
is \emph{disjoint}, as we will enforce an invariant that $\histS$,
$\histO$ and $\histJ$ do not contain timestamps in common.

The timestamps in $\hist$ determine the \emph{real-time} ordering of write
events. We record the \emph{logical} ordering in the auxiliary variable
$\ordlist$. This is a list, storing a permutation of timestamps from
$\hist$. The permutation corresponds to the logical ordering, and we
write $t_1 \tleq t_2$ if $t_1$ appears before $t_2$ in $\ordlist$. In
this sense, $\ordlist$ is the linkage in time for the snapshot
algorithm, and it will be dynamically modified. The ordering $\tleq$
is a total order (i.e., a chain), but as $\tleq$ is dynamic, and thus
subject to change by the algorithm, we introduce further notation and
name by $\jleq$ a \emph{partial suborder} of $\tleq$ that is
stable (i.e., it can only grow over time). We will define $\jleq$ later, but we can already use it to
describe the Hoare triples for {\tt write} and {\tt scan} below. In
fact, it will be important for client reasoning
(Section~\ref{sec:clients}) to keep the definition of $\jleq$ hidden,
so that different snapshot algorithms can provide different
definitions, without influencing the clients.

\begin{array}{l}
\mathtt{write}\ (p : \mathtt{ptr}, n : \mathtt{int}) : 
\!\!\!\begin{array}[t]{l}
\{\hists = \hempty \wedge h \subseteq \histO
           \wedge \omega \subseteq {\jleq}\}\\[3pt]

           h \subseteq H^{\hbox{}\sqsubseteq_\ordlist t} \wedge\,
           \mathsf{chain}\ H^{\hbox{}\sqsubseteq_\ordlist t} \wedge\, r = \mathsf{eval}\ {H^{\hbox{}\sqsubseteq_\ordlist t}}\}
\end{array}
\end{array}
\label{eq:specs}
\end{equation}
%
These are partial correctness Hoare triples, describing how the
program changes the state from the precondition (first braces) to the
postcondition (second braces), possibly influencing the return result
$r$.
%
The expression $H^{\hbox{}\sqsubseteq_\ordlist t}$ selects the entries
in the history $H$ \emph{up to and including} the timestamp $t$,
according to the ordering $\sqsubseteq_\ordlist$. Similarly in
$H^{\hbox{}\sqsubsetneq_\ordlist t}$, except that we exclude $t$.
%

With that in mind, the spec for {\tt write} says the following. We
start with the empty self history indicating that the procedure did
not yet make any writes. We use the variable $h$ to name an arbitrary
subset of the initial value of $\histO$ (hence, of \emph{completed}
write events), and the variable $\omega$ for a subset of the initial
ordering $\jleq$. The postcondition says that when {\tt write}
terminates, one write event $t \mapsto (p, v)$ has finished, and is
hence placed into $\histS$.  $\histO$ and $\jleq$ may have changed
from the previous values, but they still include $h$ and $\omega$ as
subsets. That is, $\histO$ could \emph{only grow}, because other
threads could have created new write events. Similarly for $\jleq$:
other threads could change the ordering in $\ordlist$, but only in a
way which add more relationships between timestamps in
$\jleq$. Lastly, the conjunct
$h \subseteq H^{\hbox{}\sqsubsetneq_\ordlist t}$ says the write events
that have been completed before the call to {\tt write} (and are hence
stored in $h$) will be \emph{ordered before} the event $t$ in
$\sqsubsetneq_\ordlist$. Other threads can permute $L$ to reorder some
entries, but in $L$, $t$ will remain \emph{strictly} after all the
entries from $h$.

The spec for {\tt scan} starts with the same precondition. In the
postcondition, it says that $\histS$ is empty, because {\tt scan}
itself does not execute write events. However, by the time {\tt scan}
returns the pair $r$ as a snapshot, we know that there exists a
timestamp $t$ in the collective history $H$ of the data structure at
which the snapshot \emph{appears} to be taken. First, the conjunct
$h \subseteq H^{\hbox{}\sqsubseteq_\ordlist t}$ indicates that the
snapshot is taken \emph{after} the call to {\tt scan}, because the
finished events stored in $h$ are ordered before (or at best, at)
timestamp $t$. Second, the set $H^{\hbox{}\sqsubseteq_\ordlist t}$ is
a subchain in $\sqsubseteq_\ordlist$ (technically, all its entries are
ordered in $\sqsubseteq_\ordlist$). Intuitively, the chain provides a
way to see how the history logically progressed up to the snapshotting
moment $t$, and moreover, this view will not change in the future in a
way which invalidates $r$ as a snapshot (since $\sqsubseteq_\ordlist$
is stable). Finally, if the chain of writes is evaluated in the order
given by $L$, it produces the snapshot $r$.

\paragraph{Additional auxiliary state.} 
We require yet further structure to describe the admissible ways in
which $\ordlist$ can change while respecting the
specs~(\ref{eq:specs}).

First, we require several variables that will record the code point in
which an executing writer or a scanner currently are. For example, the
auxiliary bits $\sx$ and $\sy$ will be set when the scanner has
cleared the respective forwarding pointer (line~9,
Figure~\ref{fig:jayanti-snapshot}), and reset upon scanner's
termination. Variables $\wx$ and $\wy$ will record the writer state,
and range over the set $\{ \mathsf{Init}, \mathsf{Written}\ t,
\mathsf{Dirty}\ t, \mathsf{Clean}\ t\}$. Here, $t$ is the timestamp we
will logically associate with the write event. $\mathsf{Init}$
indicates that no write is in progress; $\mathsf{Written}\ t$ says
that writer is in line~2 in Figure~\ref{fig:jayanti-snapshot};
$\mathsf{Dirty}\ t$ says that line~3 has finished and $b$ is set
(hence, forwarding in line 5 will occur); $\mathsf{Clean}\ t$ says
that we do not need to track the writer's state anymore, and it is
free to exit.

%
Second, we need to record how events overlap in time. As typical in
linearizability, events that do not overlap will \emph{not} be reordered
wrt.~each other. In the proofs, this is required in order to establish
that the timestamp $t$ in the postcondition of {\tt write} and {\tt
  scan} always appears after the events in $h$. To address this issue,
we keep an auxiliary variable $\E$, storing a function that maps each
timestamp $t$ of a \emph{finished} write events in $\hist$, to a
timestamp identifying the \emph{ending time} of the event.
%
Third, we need to track the visibility of write events with regard to
an ongoing scan method (i.e., is the write missed by the scan). This
will inform how events are reordered in $\ordlist$. We do so by
introducing \emph{colors} for timestamps: $\mathsf{green}$,
$\mathsf{yellow}$ and $\mathsf{red}$. We keep an auxiliary variable
$\C$, storing a function that maps each timestamp in $\hist$ to a
color.
%
The intuition behind the colors is as follows. It is always relative
to the ongoing scan, or the last finished one, if no scans are active.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Green timestamps identify write events that the scan is
  guaranteed to see. This includes the events that finished before the
  scan started. The order of green timestamps in $\ordlist$ is fixed
  in the following sense: if $\C(t_1) = \mathsf{green}$ and
  $t_1 \tle t_2$, then $t_2$ will never be reordered before $t_1$ in
  $\ordlist$.

\item Yellow timestamps are undecided. The scan may or may not see
  them, hence they may be reorder in $\ordlist$. Due to the
  single-writer/single-scanner assumption, $\hist$ contains at most
  one yellow timestamp per pointer.

\item Red timestamps are guaranteed to be missed by the scan. They
  will be put after the green ones.
\end{itemize}
%
%Color patters turn out to be a very flexible and maleable abstraction
%in order to reasoning about the state of the resource. \gad{I'm
%  looking for a formal way of saying that programming/reasoning about
%  the color lemmas is fun, at least for a FP-minded guy!}

%% In order to prove the correctness of these specs, we introduce the
%% invariants imposed on our axiliary state, as well as the
%% implementation in FCSL of the algorithm, decorated with auxiliary code:

\noindent
%
We can now define $\jleq$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
 t_1 \jleq t_2  = (t_1 = t_2) \vee (E\,(t_1) < t_2) \vee
 (t_1\tle t_2 \wedge \C(t_1) = \mathsf{green}) \label{def-jleq}
\end{equation}
Intuitively, the ordering $t_1 \jleq t_2$ is stable because either the
events associated with $t_1$ and $t_2$ are equal, or non-overlapping,
or $t_1$ is green, and hence fixed, as commented previously.


\paragraph{Invariants}%
The following are (selected) properties relevant to the proof of
specs~\eqref{eq:specs}, that the state (real and auxiliary) of the snapshot
algorithm satisfies throughout execution.  \an{Some are mostly obvious
  book-keeping properties, but some are essential. We should present
  only the important ones.}
\begin{enumerate}

% Self/other histories record finish writes.
\item\label{inv:gapless} $\hist$ is gapless, i.e., contains all the timestamps between
  $0$ and the maximal one. Moreover, each timestamp is associated with
  either the pointer $x$ or the pointer $y$; if we denote by $\histx$
  and $\histy$ the entries in $\hist$ writing into $x$ and $y$
  respectively, then $\hist = \histx \hunion \histy$. \an{removable?}

% Self/other histories record finish writes.
\item\label{inv:finished} $\histS$ and $\histO$ record finished writes: $\dom{E} =
  \dom{\histS \hunion \histO}$. \an{removable?}

% Color invariant
\item\label{inv:color} The colors of the timestamps in $\histx$ and
  $\histy$ can be described by the regular expression $\GYR$. They
  start with a prefix of \emph{at least} one green timestamp, followed
  by \emph{at most} one yellow timestamp, and zero or more reds in the
  tail. Importantly, there is always a (green) entry describing the
  initial write into each $x$ and $y$.
%
%  i.e. the coloring of each of the pointer-view histories satisfies
%  the pattern: many (at least one) green, at most one yellow, zero or
%  more red. \gad{Will I need the refinements?}. This pattern entails
%  that there is an initial value in each of $\histx$ and $\histy$ and,
%  moreover, that initial write is {\bf green}. One of those initial
%  timestamps will be $0$, i.e. $C(0)= green$. In addition, each
%  pointer-view history is sorted in real time -- naturally sorted--
%  and its elements don't overlap.

%% Non-Overlapping are sorted
\item\label{inv:overlap} The ending real time of a finished event
  appears after the initial real time: $\forall\, t \in
  \dom{E}\ldot\ t \leq E(t)$. \an{removable?}  Moreover, events that
  do not overlap in real time are ordered in logical time: $\forall
  t_1 \in \dom{E}, t_2 \in \dom{\hist}$, if $E(t_1) < t_2$ then $t_1
  \tle t_2$.

%% Last keys
\item\label{inv:lastkey} The entry of the last timestamp in $\histx$
  contains the physical value of $\x$: $\x = \histx (\mathsf{last}\,
  \histx)$. Similarly for $y$. \an{removable?}

%% Key Inv for fp
\item\label{inv:forward} If the scanner has cleared $\mathit{fx}$
  ($\sx = \TT$) but a non-$\bot$ value $v$ has been forwarded since
  ($\mathit{fx} = v$), then this is recorded by $\histx$:
  $\exists t\ldot t \mapsto (x, v) \in \histx$. Moreover, $t$ will be
  considered by the scanner, i.e., $t$ is the last green or the yellow
  timestamp in $\histx$. Dually for $\y$.

%  For each $\mathtt{p} \in \{\mathtt{x},\mathtt{y}\}$, if $(S_p \wedge
%  \mathtt{f\_of\ p}= v)$ then exists $t_p$ such that $t_p \hpts (p,v)
%  \in \hist$ and $t_p$ is the last green or yellow timestamp of
%  $\hist_{\mathtt{p}}$ i.e. $t_x = \mathsf{last\_green}\ \histx \vee
%  t_p = \mathsf{yellow\_ts}\ \hist_{\mathtt{p}}$. This property
%  entails that after the scanner has cleared the forwarding pointers,
%  if some new value has been forwarded, its timestamp is the last
%  green or the yellow of the pointer's view-history.

%% Key Inv for p
\item\label{inv:scanner} If the scanner has cleared $\mathit{fx}$
  ($\sx = \TT$), but still has not turned off $\s$ (i.e., it is in
  lines 9-11 in Figure~\ref{fig:jayanti-snapshot}), and $\x = v$ in
  physical state, then this is recorded by $\histx$:
  $\exists t\ldot t \mapsto (x, v) \in \histx$. Moreover, $t$ will be
  considered by the scanner, i.e., $t$ is the last green or the yellow
  timestamp in $\histx$. Dually for $\y$.

%  For each $\mathtt{p} \in \{\mathtt{x},\mathtt{y}\}$, if $(S_p
%  \wedge \mathtt{S})$ then exists $t_p$ such that $t_p \hpts (p,v) \in
%  \hist$ and $t_p$ is, again, the last green or yellow timestamp of
%  $\hist_{\mathtt{p}}$ i.e. $t_x = \mathsf{last\_green}\ \histx \vee
%  t_p = \mathsf{yellow\_ts}\ \hist_{\mathtt{p}}$. This property
%  entails that after the in the scanner has cleared the forwarding
%  pointers and before it unsets the scanner bit {\tt S}, the current
%  value of the pointer was committed by the last green or the yellow
%  timestamp of the pointer's view-history.

%% RedZone invariant
\item\label{inv:redzone} 
%
If $\s = \FF, \sx = \TT, \sy = \TT$, i.e., the scanner is in lines
12-15 in Figure~\ref{fig:jayanti-snapshot}, then $\hist$ satisfies the
$\RZ$ pattern. In other words, if a new write events occur at this
point, it will be colored red, and hence ignored by the scanner.

%If $\wstate{S} = (\FF,\TT,\TT)$ then $\hist$ satisfies the $\RZ$
%coloring pattern: if there is a red timestamp in $\hist$, then then
%the {\sf first} red timestamp partitions $\hist$ so that everything
%before it is yellow or green and everything starting from it is red.
  
\end{enumerate}
%\gad{to do: I'm not sure how deep I should get into the invariants?
%  Won't know for sure until I finish with the proof sketch. We might
%  cut down on them later.}

%\gad{Also: I'm thinking of pushing the invariants down together with
%  the proof sketch, or even fork them together as a separate section
%  sketching the ``correctness'' of our approach}

\input{fcsl-snapshot}

\paragraph{Implementation}%

Figure~\ref{fig:fcsl-snapshot} now presents the annotation of
Jayanti's procedures. We use $\langle$ angle braces $\rangle$ to
enclose a real command with auxiliary code that executes
simultaneously with it.  Note that it is is precisely this auxiliary
procedures that describe how the linearization points of Jayanti's
algorithms are determined, depending on run-time events.
%
As customary in Hoare logic, the auxiliary code is \emph{eraseable};
that is, it only mutates auxiliary variables, but does not modify the
real state. 
%
We name auxiliary code as one would name procedure calls, and proceed
to describe these procedures. Each of them is essentially a
straightforward sequence of reads from some auxiliary variables
followed by assignments of new values to the same variables. Thus
makes it convenient to present each procedures as a Hoare triple,
listing in the precondition the variables read, followed by the newly
assigned values in the postcondition. Unmentioned variables are
considered unchanged.
%
%We present a Hoare-style specification of the auxiliary code so as to
%provide an intuition on how the system evolves. We present the
%auxiliary code transitions as if they act only on parts of the state
%-- e.g. $\wstate{x}$, $\hist$ -- but in fact, they act on the whole
%state of the resource and each of them is required to preserve the
%invariants of the joint state described above. We begin with {\tt

\noindent
%
For example, $\aux{register}(p, v)$ is executed in line~2 in
Figure~\ref{fig:fcsl-snapshot}, together with the writing of $v$ into
$p$. It allocates a fresh timestamp $t = \mathsf{fresh}\ H$ which will
identify this write, and inserts the appropriate entry
$t \mapsto (p, v)$ into $\histJ$. Next $t$ is added to the end of
$\ordlist$, hence, $t$ will logically appear as a last, until and
unless $\ordlist$ is permuted later. The writer state variable $\wpp$
is changed to indicate that writer finished line~2, with a timestamp
$t$ allocated. The color of $t$ is set to yellow if $\s \& \spp$. In
other words, if an active scanner is in lines 7-9, it is not yet
determined if the write event will be seen or missed by that
scanner. Otherwise, $t$ is painted red, and thus either no scanner
exists, or $t$ will definitely be missed.
%
In line~3, $\aux{check}(p,b)$, depending on $b$, marks the current
write as $\mathsf{Dirty}$ (hence, a scan is in progress, and we should
forward the write), or as $\mathsf{Clean}$, and ready to terminate.
%
In line~5, \aux{forward} paints the allocated timestamp green
(since the scanner is active and in the right lines), because the
event, being forwarded, will definitely be seen by the scanner.
%
$\aux{Finalize}$ moves the current write event from the joint
history $\histJ$ to the thread's self history $\histS$, thus
finalizing it. The maximal currently allocated timestamp of $\hist$ is recorded
in $\E$ as the ending time of the event.
