\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Here we conclude.  Say we will finish formalization soon. Say we will
put is as soon as possible at the project
website~\cite{FCSL:Project}.

%% \gad{which is true, we might finish
%% while they are reviewing and, if I want to have a thesis by the end of
%% the year, surely before the notification}.

What to do next: Dodds et.al.'s stack~\cite{Dodds-al:POPL15}, other 
generalizations of Jayanti's snapshot algorithm, Petrank and Timnat's
iterators based upon snapshots~\cite{Petrank-Timnat:DISC13}, Herlihy-Wing's
queue~\cite{Herlihy-Wing:TOPLAS90}.
