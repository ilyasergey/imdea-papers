Submission

Papers are to be submitted electronically through easychair at
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=podc2016 following the
guidelines available on the conference web page www.podc.org. All
submissions must be in English, in pdf format. Note that the deadline
is firm.

A submission for a regular presentation must report original
research. Papers submitted for regular presentations must contain
results that have not previously appeared, and have not been
concurrently submitted to a journal or conference with published
proceedings. Any partial overlap with any such published or
concurrently submitted paper must be clearly indicated. Papers for
regular presentation must include:

- A cover page, stating the title of the paper, the authors’ names
    and affiliations, the corresponding author’s e-mail, an abstract,
    and an indication of whether the paper should be considered for
    the best student paper award, and if so the name(s) of the
    student(s) recommended for the award

- an extended abstract of up to 10 pages (excluding the cover page and
    references)

- references.

Additional details may be included in a clearly marked appendix, which
will be read at the discretion of the program committee. This appendix
may simply be the complete paper. A regular submission that is not
selected for regular presentation may be invited for a brief
announcement.

A submission for a brief announcement must be no longer than 3
single-column pages on letter-size paper, including title, authors’
names and affiliations, and references. Such submissions may describe
work in progress or work presented elsewhere. The title of a brief
announcement must begin with the words “Brief Announcement:”

Formatting for both regular submissions and brief announcements:
letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper, single-column format, using at
least 1 inch margins, 11-point font. Submissions deviating from these
guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
