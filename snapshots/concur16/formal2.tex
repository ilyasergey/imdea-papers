\gad{ Leave the beginning of the section as it is up to the auxiliary
  state, and then introduce Jayanti's FPs. Then follow to describe how
  we are implementing them and how they relate to
  Invariants~\ref{inv:forward},~\ref{inv:scanner}
  and~\ref{inv:redzone}.}

\subparagraph*{Specification.}
%
We record a history of the snapshot data structure as a set of entries
of the form $t \mapsto (p, v)$. The entry says that at time $t$ (a
natural number), the value $v$ was written into pointer $p$. Unlike in
the linearizability proof of the snapshot structure, we keep only
write events in the history. The scan events do not modify the
abstract state of the structure observable by clients, and can thus be
omitted to simplify the reasoning process.

We keep the following \emph{auxiliary} variables, which are local to
each thread: $\histS$ keeps the finished write events of the
\emph{self} thread, $\histO$ keeps the finished write events of all
other threads, while $\histJ$ keeps the write events that are in
progress. When a call to {\tt write} is initiated, an auxiliary code
will place an appropriate write entry into $\histJ$; when a call
finishes, the entry is moved from $\histJ$ to $\histS$. When one
thread changes its own $\histS$, this immediately changes every other
thread's $\histO$---a discipline provided automatically by FCSL. We
name by $\hist$ the union $\histS \hunion \histO \hunion \histJ$,
which is the history of the overall snapshot data structure. Moreover,
the latter is a \emph{disjoint union}, enforcing that $\histS$, $\histO$
and $\histJ$ do not contain common timestamps.

The timestamps in $\hist$ determine the \emph{real-time} ordering of
write events. We record the \emph{logical} ordering in the auxiliary
variable $\ordlist$. This is a list, storing a permutation of
timestamps from $\hist$. The permutation corresponds to the logical
ordering, and we write $t_1 \tleq t_2$ if $t_1$ appears before $t_2$
in $\ordlist$. In this sense, $\ordlist$ is the linkage in time for
the snapshot algorithm, and it will be dynamically modified. The
ordering $\tleq$ is a total order (i.e., a chain), but as $\tleq$ is
dynamic, and thus subject to change by the algorithm, we introduce
further notation and name by $\jleq$ a \emph{partial suborder} of
$\tleq$ that is stable and monotonic (i.e., it can only grow over
time, preserving the order). We will define $\jleq$ later, but we can
already use it to give Hoare triples for {\tt write} and {\tt scan}
below. In fact, it will be important for client reasoning
(Section~\ref{sec:clients}) to keep the definition of $\jleq$ hidden,
so that different snapshot algorithms can provide different
definitions, without influencing the clients.

\label{eq:specs}
\end{equation}
%
These are partial correctness Hoare triples, describing how the
program changes the state from the precondition (first braces) to the
postcondition (second braces), possibly influencing the return result
$r$.
%
The expression $H^{\hbox{}\sqsubseteq_\ordlist t}$ selects the entries
in the history $H$ \emph{up to and including} the timestamp $t$,
according to the ordering $\sqsubseteq_\ordlist$. Likewise,
$H^{\hbox{}\sqsubsetneq_\ordlist t}$ is defined to exclude $t$, {\it
  mutatis~mutandis}.
%

With that in mind, the spec for {\tt write} says the following. We
start with the empty self history indicating that the procedure did
not yet make any writes. We use the variable $h$ to name an arbitrary
subset of the initial value of $\histO$ (hence, of \emph{completed}
write events), and the variable $\omega$ for a subset of the initial
ordering $\jleq$. The postcondition says that when {\tt write}
terminates, one write event $t \mapsto (p, v)$ has finished, and is
hence placed into $\histS$.  $\histO$ and $\jleq$ may have changed
from the previous values, but they still include $h$ and $\omega$ as
subsets. That is, $\histO$ could \emph{only grow}, because other
threads could have created new write events. Similarly for $\jleq$:
other threads could change the ordering in $\ordlist$, but only in a
way which add more relationships between timestamps in
$\jleq$. Lastly, the conjunct
$h \subseteq H^{\hbox{}\sqsubsetneq_\ordlist t}$ says the write events
that have been completed before the call to {\tt write} (and are hence
stored in $h$) will be \emph{ordered before} the event $t$ in
$\sqsubsetneq_\ordlist$. Other threads can permute $L$ to reorder some
entries, but in $L$, $t$ will remain \emph{strictly} after all the
entries from $h$.

The spec for {\tt scan} starts with the same precondition. In the
postcondition, it says that $\histS$ is empty, because {\tt scan}
itself does not execute write events. However, by the time {\tt scan}
returns the pair $r$ as a snapshot, we know that there exists a
timestamp $t$ in the collective history $H$ of the data structure at
which the snapshot \emph{appears} to be taken. First, the conjunct
$h \subseteq H^{\hbox{}\sqsubseteq_\ordlist t}$ indicates that the
snapshot is taken \emph{after} the call to {\tt scan}, because the
finished events stored in $h$ are ordered before (or at best, at)
timestamp $t$.
%
%% Second, the set $H^{\hbox{}\sqsubseteq_\ordlist t}$ is
%% a subchain in $\sqsubseteq_\ordlist$ (technically, all its entries are
%% ordered in $\sqsubseteq_\ordlist$).
%
%
Second, the set $H^{\hbox{}\sqsubseteq_\ordlist t}$ is a sub-chain in
$\sqsubseteq_\ordlist$, \ie $\forall\, a,b \in
H^{\hbox{}\sqsubseteq_\ordlist t}\ldot\ a \sqsubseteq_{\ordlist} b
\vee b \sqsubseteq_{\ordlist} a$.
%
Intuitively, the chain provides a way to see how the history logically
progressed up to the snapshotting moment $t$, and moreover, this view
will not change in the future in a way which invalidates $r$ as a
snapshot (since $\sqsubseteq_\ordlist$ is stable). Finally, if the
chain of writes is evaluated in the order given by $L$, it produces
the snapshot $r$.

\gad{Actually, proving that chain is stable entails proving something
  stronger: that the sub-chain $H^{\hbox{}\sqsubseteq_\ordlist t}$ is
  ``maximal'' or complete i.e. that no more entries are going to be
  added to that sub-history. This is (will be) proven by the fact that
  in the atomic moment after we have executed re-link,
  $H^{\hbox{}\sqsubseteq_\ordlist t}$ defines a green prefix from the
  very beginning up to the timestamp t, and such prefixes are stable}.

\subparagraph*{Additional auxiliary state.} 
We require yet further structure to describe the admissible ways in
which $\ordlist$ can change while respecting the
specs~(\ref{eq:specs}).

First, we will introduce auxiliary state variables in order to record
the point in which an executing writer or a scanner currently are. We
refer to them as the writer and, respectively, scanner state. The
latter is defined by the triple $(\sss, \sx, sy)$. $\sss$ belongs to
the set $\{ \sOn, \sOff\, t\}$: $\sOn$ denotes that an ongoin scanner
is in between lines 8--10, whereas $\sOff\ t$ states that the scanner
executed line 11 at logical time\ $t$ and its execution is in between
lines 11--15. Morover, the auxiliary bits $\sx$ and $\sy$ will be set
when the scanner has cleared the respective forwarding pointer
(line~9, Figure~\ref{fig:jayanti-snapshot}), and reset upon scanner's
termination. As for the writer, variables $\wx$ and $\wy$ will range
over the set $\{ \wInit, \wWrite\ t, \wDirty\ t, \wClean\ t\}$, where
$t$ is the logical timestamp of an ongoing write event. $\wInit$
indicates that there is no write operation is in progress;
$\wWrite\ t$ says that writer is in line~2 in
Figure~\ref{fig:jayanti-snapshot}; $\wDirty\ t$ says that line~3 has
finished and $b$ is set (hence, forwarding in line 5 will occur);
$\wClean\ t$ says that we do not need to track the writer's state
anymore, and it is free to exit.

Second, we need to record how events overlap in time. As typical in
linearizability, events that do not overlap will \emph{not} be
reordered wrt.~each other. In the proofs, this is required in order to
establish that the timestamp $t$ in the postcondition of {\tt write}
and {\tt scan} always appears after the events in $h$. To address this
issue, we keep an auxiliary variable $\E$, storing a function that
maps each timestamp $t$ of a \emph{finished} write events in $\hist$,
to a timestamp identifying the \emph{ending time} of the event.
%
%\gad{I will try to move the invariant for Endpoints here} 
%

Third, we need to track the visibility of write events with regard to
an ongoing scan method (i.e., is the write missed by the scan). This
will inform how events are reordered in $\ordlist$. We do so by
introducing \emph{colors} for timestamps: $\mathsf{green}$,
$\mathsf{yellow}$ and $\mathsf{red}$. We keep an auxiliary variable
$\C$, storing a function that maps each timestamp in $\hist$ to a
color.
%
The intuition behind the colors is as follows. It is always relative
to the ongoing scan, or the last finished one, if no scans are active.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Green timestamps identify write events that the scan is
  guaranteed to see. This includes the events that finished before the
  scan started. The order of green timestamps in $\ordlist$ is fixed
  in the following sense: if $\C(t_1) = \mathsf{green}$ and
  $t_1 \tle t_2$, then $t_2$ will never be reordered before $t_1$ in
  $\ordlist$.

\item Yellow timestamps are undecided. The scan may or may not see
  them, hence they may be reorder in $\ordlist$. Due to the
  single-writer/single-scanner assumption, $\hist$ contains at most
  one yellow timestamp per pointer.

\item Red timestamps are guaranteed to be missed by the scan. They
  will be put after the green ones.
\end{itemize}
%\gad{Can I put color invariant here?}

%Color patters turn out to be a very flexible and maleable abstraction
%in order to reasoning about the state of the resource. \gad{I'm
%  looking for a formal way of saying that programming/reasoning about
%  the color lemmas is fun, at least for a FP-minded guy!}

%% In order to prove the correctness of these specs, we introduce the
%% invariants imposed on our axiliary state, as well as the
%% implementation in FCSL of the algorithm, decorated with auxiliary code:

We can now define $\jleq$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
 t_1 \jleq t_2 = t_1\tleq t_2 \wedge ( E\,(t_1) < t_2) \vee \C(t_1) =
 \mathsf{green} \vee (t_1 = t_2) ) \label{def-jleq}
\end{equation}
%% %
%% \gad{I've changed the definition so that it is closer to its
%%   implementation in the Coq development.}

%% \begin{equation}
%%  t_1 \jleq t_2  = (t_1 = t_2) \vee (E\,(t_1) < t_2) \vee
%%  (t_1\tle t_2 \wedge \C(t_1) = \mathsf{green}) \label{def-jleq}
%% \end{equation}
  
Intuitively, the ordering $t_1 \jleq t_2$ is stable because either the
events associated with $t_1$ and $t_2$ are equal, or non-overlapping,
or $t_1$ is green, and hence fixed, as commented previously.

\gad{Introduce Jayanti's forwarding principles and how we implement
  them with the colors.  Use this to motivate the invariants in
  particular 6,7 and 8, which are the ones that correspond closely to
  the forwarding principles. We use the auxiliary code to implement
  Jayanti's forwarding principles. explain with a bit less
  detail. Maybe move invariants down.}

\subparagraph*{Invariants}%
The following are (selected) properties relevant to the proof of
specs~\eqref{eq:specs}, that the state (real and auxiliary) of the snapshot
algorithm satisfies throughout execution.
%% \an{Some are mostly obvious
%%   book-keeping properties, but some are essential. We should present
%%   only the important ones.}
\begin{enumerate}

%% % Self/other histories record finish
%% writes.  \item\label{inv:gapless} $\hist$ is gapless, i.e.,
%% contains all the timestamps between $0$ and the maximal
%% one. Moreover, each timestamp is associated with either the pointer
%% $x$ or the pointer $y$; if we denote by $\histx$ and $\histy$ the
%% entries in $\hist$ writing into $x$ and $y$ respectively, then
%% $\hist = \histx \hunion \histy$. \an{removable?} \gad{yes}

%% % Self/other histories record finish
%% writes.  \item\label{inv:finished} $\histS$ and $\histO$ record
%% finished writes: $\dom{E} = \dom{\histS \hunion
%% \histO}$. \an{removable?} \gad{yes}

% Color invariant
\item\label{inv:color} The colors of the timestamps in each of
  $\histx$ and $\histy$ can be described by the regular expression
  $\GYR$: They have a non-empty prefix consisting of green timestamps,
  followed by \emph{at most} one yellow timestamp, and zero or more
  red timestamps in the tail.
  %
  %% Importantly, there is always a (green)
  %%  entry describing the initial write into each $x$ and $y$.
%
%  i.e. the coloring of each of the pointer-view histories satisfies
%  the pattern: many (at least one) green, at most one yellow, zero or
%  more red. \gad{Will I need the refinements?}. This pattern entails
%  that there is an initial value in each of $\histx$ and $\histy$ and,
%  moreover, that initial write is {\bf green}. One of those initial
%  timestamps will be $0$, i.e. $C(0)= green$. In addition, each
%  pointer-view history is sorted in real time -- naturally sorted--
%  and its elements don't overlap.

%% Non-Overlapping are sorted
%% \item\label{inv:overlap} The ending real time of a finished event
%%   appears after the initial real time: $\forall\, t \in
%%   \dom{E}\ldot\ t \leq E(t)$. \an{removable?}  Moreover, events that
%%   do not overlap in real time are ordered in logical time: $\forall
%%   t_1 \in \dom{E}, t_2 \in \dom{\hist}$, if $E(t_1) < t_2$ then $t_1
%%   \tle t_2$.

\item\label{inv:overlap} The logical order $\tle$ preserves the real
  time order of {\it non-overlapping} past write events. Formally,
  $\forall t_1 \in \dom{E}, t_2 \in \dom{\hist}$, if $t_1 < t_2$ and
  $E(t_1) < t_2$ then $t_1 \tle t_2$.
  
%% %% Last keys
%% \item\label{inv:lastkey} The entry of the last timestamp in $\histx$
%%   contains the physical value of $\x$: $\x = \histx (\mathsf{last}\,
%%   \histx)$. Similarly for $y$. \an{removable?} \gad{yes}.

%% Key Inv for fp
\item\label{inv:forward} If the scanner has cleared $\mathit{fx}$
  ($\sx = \TT$) but a non-$\bot$ value $v$ has been forwarded since
  ($\mathit{fx} = v$), then this is recorded by $\histx$:
  $\exists t\ldot t \mapsto (x, v) \in \histx$. Moreover, $t$ will be
  considered by the scanner, i.e., $t$ is the last green or the yellow
  timestamp in $\histx$. Dually for $\y$.

%  For each $\mathtt{p} \in \{\mathtt{x},\mathtt{y}\}$, if $(S_p \wedge
%  \mathtt{f\_of\ p}= v)$ then exists $t_p$ such that $t_p \hpts (p,v)
%  \in \hist$ and $t_p$ is the last green or yellow timestamp of
%  $\hist_{\mathtt{p}}$ i.e. $t_x = \mathsf{last\_green}\ \histx \vee
%  t_p = \mathsf{yellow\_ts}\ \hist_{\mathtt{p}}$. This property
%  entails that after the scanner has cleared the forwarding pointers,
%  if some new value has been forwarded, its timestamp is the last
%  green or the yellow of the pointer's view-history.

%% Key Inv for p
\item\label{inv:scanner} If the scanner has cleared $\mathit{fx}$
  ($\sx = \TT$), but still has not turned off $\s$ (i.e., it is in
  lines 9-11 in Figure~\ref{fig:jayanti-snapshot}), and $\x = v$ in
  physical state, then this is recorded by $\histx$:
  $\exists t\ldot t \mapsto (x, v) \in \histx$. Moreover, $t$ will be
  considered by the scanner, i.e., $t$ is the last green or the yellow
  timestamp in $\histx$. Dually for $\y$.

%  For each $\mathtt{p} \in \{\mathtt{x},\mathtt{y}\}$, if $(S_p
%  \wedge \mathtt{S})$ then exists $t_p$ such that $t_p \hpts (p,v) \in
%  \hist$ and $t_p$ is, again, the last green or yellow timestamp of
%  $\hist_{\mathtt{p}}$ i.e. $t_x = \mathsf{last\_green}\ \histx \vee
%  t_p = \mathsf{yellow\_ts}\ \hist_{\mathtt{p}}$. This property
%  entails that after the in the scanner has cleared the forwarding
%  pointers and before it unsets the scanner bit {\tt S}, the current
%  value of the pointer was committed by the last green or the yellow
%  timestamp of the pointer's view-history.

%% RedZone invariant
\item\label{inv:redzone} 
%
If $\s = \FF, \sx = \TT, \sy = \TT$, i.e., the scanner is in lines
12-15 in Figure~\ref{fig:jayanti-snapshot}, then $\hist$ satisfies the
$\RZ$ pattern. In other words, if a new write events occur at this
point, it will be colored red, and hence ignored by the scanner.

\gad{Explain better. We might need to explain the new part of the
  red-zone invariant i.e. the one that explains the relation between
  the timestamps of the writes and $t_{\mathsf{off}}$. This is
  important for establishing that re-link only changes the order of
  overlapping events.}

%If $\wstate{S} = (\FF,\TT,\TT)$ then $\hist$ satisfies the $\RZ$
%coloring pattern: if there is a red timestamp in $\hist$, then then
%the {\sf first} red timestamp partitions $\hist$ so that everything
%before it is yellow or green and everything starting from it is red.
  
\end{enumerate}
%\gad{to do: I'm not sure how deep I should get into the invariants?
%  Won't know for sure until I finish with the proof sketch. We might
%  cut down on them later.}

%\gad{Also: I'm thinking of pushing the invariants down together with
%  the proof sketch, or even fork them together as a separate section
%  sketching the ``correctness'' of our approach}
