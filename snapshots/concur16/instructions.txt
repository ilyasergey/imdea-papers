Submissions and Publications

CONCUR solicits high quality papers reporting research results and/or
experience reports. All papers must be original, unpublished and not
submitted for publication elsewhere. Each paper will undergo a
thorough review process.

The CONCUR proceedings will be published in LIPIcs (Leibniz
International Proceedings in Informatics), published under an open
access license by Dagstuhl Publishing.  As usual, the Proceedings will
be available before the conference.

Submissions will be in electronic form via EasyChair. The usage of
pdflatex and the LIPIcs style file (see here for some formatting
tricks) are mandatory: no changes to font size, page geometry,
etc. are permitted. Authors are invited to submit a draft of at most
13 pages including references. Submissions not in the correct format
or submitted after the deadline will be rejected without further
consideration.

If necessary, the paper may be supplemented with a clearly marked
appendix, which will be reviewed at the discretion of the program
committee and the reviewers.

As usual, for an accepted paper to be included in the proceedings, one
of the authors must commit to presenting the paper at the
conference. All papers must be original and unpublished. Simultaneous
submission to other conferences or workshops with published
proceedings or to journals is not allowed.
