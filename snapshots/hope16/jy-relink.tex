%\gad{FIX ME: subfigure (b) is incorrectly drawn! 1 and 3 are swapped
%  in Real Time as well!!!}

%Fix me: The yellow should be painted red after relink, if we decide
%to go for the (green - red) split for t\left t\right after re-link.
%Though, this would not be stable after we release the lock for scan,
%so why bother. Painting the t|left chain green will suffice, as it
%will be stable.

% Fix me: red marbles have different font colors :(
