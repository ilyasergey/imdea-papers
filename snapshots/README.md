# Future Work #


## More Appendixes: ##

1. **Clients:** We have the code for one more client. Although it is
   not very interesting, we could add it to the appendix.

2. **Stability Lemmas:** As we did with the ```CONCUR2016```
   submission, we could add the appendix with the proofs of some of
   the stability lemmmas or the monotonicity lemmas for scanned
   \Omega.

3. **Atomic Specs:** we have written them down for the ```ESOP```
   submission, but we removed them in favour of a brief description of
   the proof outline.

# HW-Queue #

We've been discusing lately a spec for the HW Queue. It would be nice
to do a pen an paper proof outline with an overall description of the
atomic commands--- No implementation, though---before the rebuttal, so
if somebody asks why we didn't do HW, or if this applies to HW, we
have the proof there.

Of course, we can also say that we did not care to do *yet another*
proof of HW, since there already exists several of them. And we can do
the same for avoifing doing an implementation.
