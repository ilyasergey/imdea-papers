A list of TODO's to fix in a camera-ready paper version
-------------------------------------------

1. A small foot print-ish specifications of Priv actions: read and
write (see page 9, midle, of the paper). This way, the Framing
property (safe_zagzig) from Appendix A (Definition 3) doesn't hold.

When this is fixed (by adding administrative heaps to self and other
parts), we also need to revise the definitions of "machine" actions
(Definition 2) so they would match the specifications of the "rich"
actions.
