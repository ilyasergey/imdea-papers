<h2>Abstract</h2>

We present a novel model of concurrent computations with shared memory
and provide a simple, yet powerful, logical framework for uniform
Hoare-style reasoning about partial correctness of coarse- and
fine-grained concurrent programs. The key idea is to specify arbitrary
resource protocols as communicating state transition systems (STS)
that describe valid states of a resource and the transitions the
resource is allowed to make, including transfer of heap ownership. We
demonstrate how reasoning in terms of communicating STS makes it easy
to crystallize behavioral invariants of a resource. We also provide
entanglement operators to build large systems from an arbitrary number
of STS components, by interconnecting their lines of
communication. Furthermore, we show how the classical rules from the
Concurrent Separation Logic (CSL), such as scoped resource allocation,
can be generalized to fine-grained resource management. This allows us
to give specifications as powerful as Rely-Guarantee, in a concise,
scoped way, and yet regain the compositionality of CSL-style resource
management. We proved the soundness of our logic with respect to the
denotational semantics of action trees (variation on Brookesâ€™ action
traces). We formalized the logic as a shallow embedding in Coq and
implemented a number of examples, including a construction of coarse-grained CSL resources as a
modular composition of various logical and semantic components.
