\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented \emph{concurroids}---a novel model for scalable
shared-memory concurrency verification, based on communicating STS, and
\SCST---a logic for concurroids.

In the future work, we are going to build a number of concurroids to
encode common programming patterns. For example, dynamic allocation
and deallocation of memory can be encoded via an allocator concurroid
(without extensions of \SCST), and similarly for dynamic allocation
and deallocation of locks.
%
% We also plan to consider other combinators for building and entangling
% concurroids. In particular, 
%
We hope to investigate if concurroids can be endowed with analogues of
channel relabeling and restriction operators from process algebras, to
provide finer control over interconnection and closure of external
transitions.
%
Finally, we plan to consider refinement which allows weakening the
ascribed concurroid $U$ of a program, to a coarser-grained
concurroid~$V$, if $U$ can be shown to simulate~$V$. One could then
verify fine-grained concurrent ADTs against $V$, and afterwards hide
the granularity by switching to $U$.
