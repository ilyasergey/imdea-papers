  Hoare-style Specifications as Correctness Conditions\\
  for Non-linearizable Concurrent Objects

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

%
% 1. The setting
%

  Designing scalable concurrent objects, which can be efficiently used
  on multicore processors, often requires one to abandon standard
  specification techniques, such as \emph{linearizability}, in favor
  of more relaxed consistency requirements.
  %
  However, the variety of alternative correctness conditions makes it
  difficult to choose which one to employ in a particular case, and to
  compose them when using objects whose behaviors are specified via
  different criteria. The lack of syntactic verification methods for
  most of these criteria poses challenges in their systematic adoption
  and application.

  % 
  % To specify different useful classes of non-linearizable concurrent
  % objects, a number of alternative correctness criteria have been
  % proposed recently: \emph{Quiescent} and \emph{Quantitative
  % Quiescent Consistency}, \emph{Concurrency-Aware Linearizability},
  % and \emph{Quasi-Linearizability}, to name just a~few.
%
%
% 2. The problem(s): too many of correctness criteria
%
  % However, it is not trivial to design new concurrent correctness
  % conditions, which are compositional and general enough to
  % accommodate highly parallel concurrent objects.
  % 
  % It is even less trivial to supply these conditions with
  % compositional proof methods, making them amenable for structured
  % formal program verification.
  %
  % Finally, the diversity of existing specification approaches makes it
  % tricky to reason uniformly about client code that employs various
  % concurrent objects, whose semantics is defined via different
  % correctness criteria.

  % Furthermore, the clients of a concurrent data structure, when
  % committing to one or another correctness criterion, need to adopt
  % specific reasoning principles necessary to characterize the
  % structure's behavior. Therefore, client-side reasoning about
  % programs that incorporate several structures, specified via
  % \emph{different} criteria, might be tricky.
%
% 3. Our solution
%  

  In this paper, we argue for using Hoare-style program logics as an
  alternative and uniform approach for specification and compositional
  formal verification of safety properties for concurrent objects and
  their client programs.
  %
  Through a series of case studies, we demonstrate how an existing
  program logic for concurrency can be employed off-the-shelf to
  capture important state and history invariants, allowing one to
  \emph{explicitly quantify over interference} of environment threads
  and provide intuitive and expressive Hoare-style specifications for
  several \emph{non-linearizable} concurrent objects that were
  previously specified only via dedicated correctness criteria.
  %
  We illustrate the adequacy of our specifications by verifying a
  number of concurrent client scenarios, that make use of the
  previously specified concurrent objects, capturing the essence of
  such correctness conditions as \emph{concurrency-aware
    linearizability}, \emph{quiescent}, and \emph{quantitative
    quiescent consistency}.
  %
  % The compositionality of our approach follows from the
  % compositionality of the logical specifications, that abstract away
  % the implementation details and enable program substitution.
  % 
  % Using an existing logic off-the-shelf provides us with a general
  % structural verification method.
  %
  All examples described in this paper are verified mechanically
  in~Coq.

% Points to emphasize:

% \begin{itemize}

% \item Algorithms of multicore era: better scalability requires
%   rethinkin correctness

% \item Multiple ways to define correctness in some relaxed flavours, by
%   relating it to the sequential executions - name a few correctness
%   conditions

% \item These conditions are difficult to design and they are not even
%   supplied with the corresponding proof methods, which are easy
%   amenable for mechanization

% \item Furthermore, clients need to adapt their reasoning principles to
%   each of this criteria, and reasoning about programs that incorporate
%   structures with several criteria might be tricky

% \item We suggest program logic as a uniform framework for specifying
%   safety  aspects of concurrent objects 

% \item We illustrate the generality of the approach by providing
%   intuitive specifications to two concurrent objects, each of which
%   required a dedicated correctness condition to be specified

% \item Out of provided specifications, we verify a series of concurrent
%   client programs, which make use of the above described concurrent
%   objects

% \item All examples are verified mechanically in Coq

% \end{itemize}

  % \todo{Rephrase the abstract as follows: (1) keep the first paragraph
  %   (2) Outline the situation with the variety of alternative criteria
  %   and implications of this fact; (3) say, which alternative (Hoare
  %   logic) we consider and what benefits it brings; (4) mention the
  %   key observation that we need quantify over interference in order
  %   to provide concurrent specs for all these interesting concurrent
  %   objects. }
