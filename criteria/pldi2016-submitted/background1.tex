\section{Background on FCSL}
\label{sec:background}

A Hoare specification in FCSL has the form $\spec{P}\ e\ \spec{Q} @
\rcon$. $P$ and $Q$ are pre- and postcondition for partial
correctness, and $\rcon$ defines the \emph{shared resource} on which
$e$ operates. 
%
%We have elided $\rcon$ from the specs in
%Section~\ref{sec:overview}, but explain it now. 
%
The latter is a state transition system describing the state (real and
auxiliary) and atomic operations that can be invoked by the threads
that simultaneously operate on that state. We elide the transition
system aspect of resources here, and refer
to~\cite{Nanevski-al:ESOP14} for detailed treatment.

An important secondary role of a resource is to declare the variables
that $P$ and $Q$ may scope over. For example, in the case of
exchanger, we use the variables $\heaps, \perms, \hists$, $\heapo,
\permo, \histo$, and $\heapj, \pending$.
%
The mechanism by which the variables are declared is as
follows. Underneath, a resource comes with only three variables:
$a_\lcl$, $a_\env$ and $a_\joint$ standing for abstract self state,
other state, and shared (joint) state, but the user can pick their
types depending on the application. In the case of exchanger, $a_\lcl$
and $a_\env$ are triples containing a heap, an offer-set and a
history. The variables we used in Section~\ref{sec:overview} are
projections out of such triples: $a_\lcl\,{=}\,(\heaps, \perms,
\hists)$, and $a_\env\,{=}\,(\heapo, \permo, \histo)$. Similarly,
$a_\joint\,{=}\,(\heapj, \pending)$.

It is essential that $a_\lcl$ and $a_\env$ have a common type
exhibiting the algebraic structure of a PCM, under a partial binary
operation $\hunion$.
%
% In the case of $\cal E$, each of
%the three components of $a_\lcl$ and $a_\env$---heaps, offer-sets and
%histories---form a PCM, where $\bullet$ is disjoint union $\hunion$,
%and $\emptyset$ is the unit. Hence, the product of the three is a PCM
%as well, with $\bullet$ and unit defined point-wise. 
PCMs give a way, generic in $\rcon$, to define the
inference rule for parallel composition.
%
\[
\tag{\normalsize \arabic{tags}}\refstepcounter{tags}\label{eq:parrule}
{\small{
\begin{array}{c}
\specK{\{P_1\}}\ e_1\ \specK{\{Q_1\}} @ \rcon \quad \specK{\{P_2\}}\ e_2\ \specK{\{Q_2\}} @ \rcon\\[2pt]
\hline\\[-7pt]
\specK{\{P_1 \circledast P_2\}}\ e_1 \parallel e_2\ \specK{\{[\res.1/\res]Q_1 \circledast [\res.2/\res]Q_2\}} @ \rcon
\end{array}
}}
\]
%
Here, $\circledast$ is defined as follows.
\[
%\tag{\normalsize \arabic{tags}}\refstepcounter{tags}\label{eq:ssep}
\begin{array}{c}
(P_1 \circledast P_2)(a_\lcl, a_\joint, a_\env) \iff \exists x_1~x_2\ldot a_\lcl = x_1 \hunion x_2, \hbox{}\\
 P_1 (x_1, a_\joint, x_2 \hunion a_\env), P_2 (x_2, a_\joint, x_1 \hunion a_\env)
\end{array}
\]
%
%
Thereby, when a parent thread forks $e_1$ and $e_2$, then $e_1$
becomes part of the environment for $e_2$, and vice-versa. This is so
because the \emph{self} component $a_\lcl$ of the parent is split into
$x_1$ and $x_2$; $x_1$ becomes the \emph{self} part of $e_1$, but
$x_2$ is added to the \emph{other} part $a_\env$ of $e_1$ (and
symmetrically for $e_2$).
%
%Also note that parallel composition returns a pair of the outputs
%produced by $e_1$ and $e_2$. Thus, the variable $\res$ in $Q_1$ and
%$Q_2$ has to be appropriately renamed by the projections $\res.1$ and
%$\res.2$ in the postcondition of the parallel composition.

%The rule of frame of FCSL is a special case of parallel composition,
%when $e_2$ is the idle thread.
%%
%\[
%\tag{\normalsize \arabic{tags}}\refstepcounter{tags}\label{eq:frame}
%{\small{
%\begin{array}{c}
%\specK{\{P_1\}}\ e\ \specK{\{P_2\}} @ \rcon\\[2pt]
%\hline\\[-7pt]
%\specK{\{P_1 \circledast Q\}}\ e\ \specK{\{P_1 \circledast Q\}} @ \rcon
%\end{array}\qquad 
%\begin{array}{c}
%\mbox{$Q$ stable under}\\
%\mbox{$\rcon$'s transitions}
%\end{array}
%}}
%\]
%A notable difference from the frame rules of other separation logics
%is that FCSL's definition of $\circledast$ forces that the value being
%framed onto \emph{self} component is \emph{subtracted} from the
%\emph{other} component, whereas in other separation logic, the frame
%value materializes out of nowhere. To illustrate, we can frame
%$\gists$ onto the history $\hists$ in the the
%spec~(\ref{tag:exchangespec}), by taking
%$\rcon\,{\eqdef}\,a_\lcl\,{=}\,(\heaps, \hists,
%\perms)\,{=}\,(\emptyset, \gists, \emptyset)$.
%We obtain, after some simplification:
%%
%\[
%{\small{
%\begin{array}{c}
%\specK{\{\heaps = \emptyset, \perms = \emptyset, \hists = \gists, \gist \subseteq \gists \hunion \histo \hunion \mygather{\pending}\}}\\[2pt]
%\mathtt{exchange}\ v \\[2pt]
%\spec{\!\!
%  \begin{array}{c}
%    \heaps = \emptyset, \perms = \emptyset, \gist \subseteq \gists \hunion \histo \hunion \mygather{\pending}, \hbox{}\\[1pt]
%    \mathsf{if}\ \res\ \mathsf{is}\ \mathsf{Some}\ w\ \mathsf{then}\\[1pt]
%    \exists t\ldot \hists = t \mapsto (v, w) \hunion \gists, 
%    \mathsf{last} (\gist) < t, \twin{t}~\mathsf{else}\ \hists = \gists    
%  \end{array}
%\!\!}@\cal E
%\end{array}
%}}
%\]
%But notice how the spec now says that $\gist \subseteq \gists \hunion
%\histo \hunion \mygather{\pending}$, whereas
%in~(\ref{tag:exchangespec}) it said $\gist \subseteq \histo \hunion
%\mygather{\pending}$. The addition of $\gists$ compensates for
%$\gists$ having been subtracted out of $\histo$, to be moved to
%$\hists$.

To reason about quiescent moments, we use one more constructor of
FCSL: \emph{hiding}. The program $\mathsf{hide}\ e$ operationally
executes $e$, but logically installs a resource within the scope of
$e$. In the case of the exchanger, $\mathsf{hide}\ e$ starts only with
private heaps $\heaps$ and $\heapo$, then takes a chunk of heap out of
$\heaps$ and ``installs'' an exchanger in this heap, allowing the
threads in $e$ to exchange values. $\mathsf{hide}\ e$ is
\emph{quiescent} wrt.~exchanger, as the typechecker will prevent
composing $\mathsf{hide}\ e$ with threads that want to exchange values
with $e$.

The auxiliaries $\perms, \hists$, $\permo, \histo$, and $\heapj,
\pending$, belonging to the exchanger (denoted as resource $\cal E$)
are visible within $\mathsf{hide}$, but outside, only $\heaps$
persists (denoted as a resource $\cal P$ for private state).  We elide
the general hiding rule~\cite{Nanevski-al:ESOP14}, and just show the
special case for the exchanger.
\[
%\tag{\normalsize \arabic{tags}}\refstepcounter{tags}\label{eq:ehide}
{\small{
\begin{array}{c}
\specK{\{P\}}\ e\ \specK{\{Q\}} @ \cal E\\[2pt]
\hline\\[-7pt]
\specK{\{\heaps = \Phi_1(\heapj), \Phi_1(P)\}}\ \mathsf{hide}~e\ \specK{\{\exists \Phi_2\ldot \heaps = \Phi_2(\heapj), \Phi_2(Q)\}} @ \cal P
\end{array}
}}
\]
Read bottom-up, the rule says that we can install the exchanger $\cal
E$ in the scope of a thread that works with $\cal P$, but then we need
substitutions $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$, to map variables of $\cal E$
($\heaps, \perms, \hists$, \etc) to values expressed with variables
from $\cal P$ ($\heaps$ and $\heapo$). $\Phi_1$ is an initial such
substitution (user provided), and the rule guarantees the existence of
an ending substitution $\Phi_2$. The substitutions have to satisfy a
number of side conditions, which we elide here for brevity. The most
important one is that \emph{other} variable $a_\env = (\heapo, \permo,
\histo)$ is fixed to be the PCM unit (\ie,~a triple of empty
sets). Fixing $a_\env$ to unit captures that $\mathsf{hide}$ protects
$e$ from interference.

At the beginning of $\mathsf{hide}~e$, the private heap equals the
value that $\Phi_1$ gives to $\heapj$ ($\heaps = \Phi_1(\heapj)$). In
other words, the $\mathsf{hide}$ rule takes the private heap of a
thread, and makes it shared, \ie, gives it to the $\heapj$ component
of $\cal E$. Upon finishing, $\mathsf{hide}~e$ makes $\heapj$ private
again.
%
%($\heaps = \Phi_2(\heapj)$).

%\an{Should I say something about compositionality? Why is FCSL
%  compositional? Maybe say, soundness of FCSL has been established by
%  shallow embeding in Coq. Thus, the logic immediately inherits the
%  substitution principle, thereby allowing that clients can reason
%  only out of the Hoare spec of an object.}
