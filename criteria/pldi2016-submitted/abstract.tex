  Designing efficient concurrent objects often requires abandoning the
  standard specification technique of \emph{linearizability} in favor
  of more relaxed correctness conditions.
%
  However, the variety of alternatives makes it difficult to choose
  which condition to employ, and how to compose them when using
  objects specified by different conditions.

  %The lack of syntactic verification methods for most of these
  %criteria poses challenges in their systematic adoption and
  %mechanization.

  In this work, we propose a \emph{uniform} alternative in the form of
  Hoare logic which can explicitly capture---in the auxiliary
  state---the interference of environment threads.
%
  We demonstrate the expressiveness of our method by verifying a
  number of concurrent objects and their clients, which have so far
  been specified only by non-standard conditions of
  \emph{concurrency-aware linearizability}, \emph{quiescent}, and
  \emph{quantitative quiescent consistency}.
% 
  We report on the implementation of the ideas in an existing
  Coq-based tool, providing the first mechanized proofs for all the
  examples in the paper.
