The list of revisions and additions made to the paper "Hoare-style
Specifications as Correctness Conditions for Non-linearizable
Concurrent Objects" for the second round of OOPSLA'16 submission.

Major Changes
=============

  * [Section 2] The "Main Ideas and Overview" section has been split
    into two new sections, with the verification of the exchanger
    implementation moved to a separate Section 3.

    Section 2 now discusses two simple motivating examples: the
    exchanger (focusing on its use, without exploring the
    implementation) and a simplified version of the counting network,
    featuring two un-synchronized atomic updates to a shared
    pointer. Both concurrent structures are first presented from the
    practical perspective of using them.

    The section then explains how to (i) define the temporal/spatial
    invariants for them (using a coloring scheme as an intuition for
    subjective state dichotomy), (ii) capture the effect on history
    with respect to interference in Hoare-style specs, and (iii)
    immediately employ the specifications for verification of
    heterogeneous client programs.

    The section is concludes with the 3-step summary of the
    formalization pattern.

  * [Section 10] The Related Work section has been expanded with a
    discussion on related logics and approaches for specifying
    concurrent programs (including the Views framework), incorporating
    the corresponding parts of the first round rebuttal.

Other Changes
=============

  * [Section 1.2] The introduction now better emphasizes the
    contribution of the work, stating some parts of it as "conceptual"
    (the method) and some other parts as "technical" (the verified
    case studies).

  * [Section 9] The case studies are re-run with the lates Coq version
    to date (8.5pl2), which slightly changed the compilation times
    (see Table 1). Some of the times have increased, though, but more
    detailed forensic work will be required to understand why.

  * Explanations from the rebuttal are incorporated to the test (see
    the diff).

  * Multiple small clarifications in the text of sections describing
    the case studies and relating the overall presentation to the
    initial toy examples.
