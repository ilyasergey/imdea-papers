Thank you for agreeing to review the artifact for our submission entitled "Hoare-style Specifications as Correctness Conditions for Non-linearizable Concurrent Objects".

The artifact is represented by the Coq sources of the implementation of Fine-grained Separation Logic (FCSL) in the Coq proof assistant, as well as the case studies conducted for the OOPSLA'16 submission.

There are two possible ways to try it out, which we describe below.

1. Using the ZIP archive with the sources of FCSL and case studies.

In order to compile and check the sources, you will need to have Coq 8.5pl1 and Ssreflect 1.6 installed. They can be downloaded from the following sites:

* https://coq.inria.fr/coq-85
* https://math-comp.github.io/math-comp/

We recommend to use Emacs with installed Proof General mode (https://github.com/emacsattic/proofgeneral) to browse and step through the sources.

Once you have Coq/Ssreflect installed, follow the instructions in the README.md file of the fcsl-oopsla16.zip archive to build the project. It takes around 40 minutes to build the project and all case studies, so, please, be patient.

The README.md file also provides commentary on the case studies from the paper, located in the folder [Examples/NonLinearizable].

If you are interested in more details of FCSL and past case studies,
we encourage you to check the FCSL reference manual:

* http://software.imdea.org/fcsl/papers/fcsl-manual.pdf

2. Using the VirtualBox VM image.

You can also use the VirtualBox VM image with Coq/Ssreflect/Emacs/Proof General installed. The VM image is available by the link in the artifact description. It requires VirtualBox 5.0 (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) to run.

Once downloaded and launched, navigate to the ~/fcsl-oopsla16 folder to browse the project sources. The project is already compiled, but you can follow the instructions from README.md file in order to re-build the project (this will automatically check all the proofs).

Use Emacs with Proof General mode to step through *.v files from the [Examples/NonLinearizable] folder. The commentary with respect to specific case studies is provided in the README.md file.

Whenever necessary, use "coquser" as the username and password.
